# Phase 32 Guardrails — Execution Under Explicit Authority

Phase 32 permits execution only under explicit, external authorization.

Execution is forbidden unless:
- an authorization file exists
- authority is validated
- the action is registered
- the kill switch is disabled

Phase 32 does not decide what to do.
It only performs what has been authorized.

Deleting Phase 32 must immediately remove execution capability.
